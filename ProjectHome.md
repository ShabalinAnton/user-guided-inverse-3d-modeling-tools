This project aims to be a public re-implementation of [User-Guided Inverse 3D Modeling](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-103.html), a method for editing 3D shapes (such as a polygonal mesh) by letting the user impose the high-level structure that is most useful for editing.  It is essentially a collection of fast reverse-engineering modules that fit primitive structures (such as quadrics, sweeps, etc) to a 3D surface (while offering user control over exactly which structure are fit and where), and then in the same system lets the user use those fitted structures to edit the shape.

Currently, this release has the first module implemented: A "stationary sweep" module that lets users fit helical structures and surfaces of revolution, and then edit those shapes by (for example) changing the cross-section.  More general forms of sweep editing, freeform surface editing, and quadric surface editing, and CSG-based reverse engineering will be released later.

If you are a looking for lightweight libraries to help implement fast reverse engineering methods such as the ones used in this system, I have also made library versions of some of the fitting methods used in this system:
Quadric fitting: https://code.google.com/p/type-specific-direct-quadric-fitting/
Kinematic surface fitting (i.e., for fitting surfaces of revolution, helices, exponential snail shells, cones, etc): https://code.google.com/p/generalized-basis-independent-kinematic-surface-fitting/
